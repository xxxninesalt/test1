# Here is my undergraduate third year project
### This project investigates Euclidean rhythms. My methodology is to produce an application based on the react framework that allows users to freely create different euclidean rhythms and view the soundwave of it, to facilitate them the understanding of euclidean properties and applications in musical composition.
## To run the project, please do following steps
<br/>
### 1. npm install react-scripts
### 2. nvm use 16
### 3. npm start
